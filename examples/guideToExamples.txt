We have several folders for examples of unreduced simulations of 3D solid elasticity.
== vv LEAST COMPLEX vv ==
  208 vertices: beam <== trivial
  347 vertices: turtle <== very good start (non-homogeneous material properties: backshell is made of harder material)
  347 vertices: orthotropic turtle <== demonstrates real-time orthotropic materials
  959 vertices: asianDragon <== demonstrates unconstrained (free-fly) motion; also demonstrates Mooney-Rivlin material
 4000 vertices: simpleBridge
 9875 vertices: towerCrane <== runs at 2 fps on our machines
25620 vertices: tube <== offline orthotropic
47736 vertices: dragon <== offline

The cloth examples are in the "cloth" folder. They demonstrate bending, and a cloth sheet suspended under gravity.

The mesher examples are in the "mesher" folder. They demonstrate how to use Vega's meshing capabilities.

The virtual tets examples are in the "virtualTets" folder. They demonstrate how to use Vega's virtual tets algorithm to create tet meshes to embed nearly-self-intersecting surfaces.
Run script runMesher_* in virtualTets/ to create the tet mesh and interpolation file, and then run script edit_* to deform the resulting tet mesh with ARAP. 

The immersion mesher examples are in the "immersionMesher" folder. They demonstrate how to use Vega's immersion algorithm to create tet meshes to embed self-intersecting surfaces.
Run script runMesher_* in immersionMesher/ to create the tet mesh and interpolation file, and then run script edit_* to deform the resulting tet mesh with ARAP.
